   Editor:
I have just finished reading
the <date when=" 1953-11-13" >November 13th</date> <sic>Racktalk</sic>
column. This fuss over the jazz
issue has been very amusing,
very interesting, and also very
idiotic. Although I am a Dixie­
land fan (“fig” to the modern
cats), I am not trying to sell
my interests to anyone. I would,
however, like to clear up loose
and sloppy ends.</p>
<p>Modern jazz is definitely a
progressive form of music. It is
directly connected to commer­
cialism, big bands, arrange­
ments and the public. The par­
ticipants in a modern jazz band
play to and for the people.
Their style of music is high­
strung, fast and loud. Its
uniqueness is the installment of
new sounds and an inexhaust­
ible supply of new songs, all of
which sound exactly the same to
anybody other than the “gates”
who dig the stuff.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Dixieland
is a backstreet sort of jazz. The
musicians are highly artistic
and do not rely on orchestra­
tions or arrangements. Nor do
they have or need a director. If
anyone wishes to “sit <sic>ip</sic>” and
listen, they «re welcome. The
characteristics of a jazz band
of this sort are: smallness (usu­
ally limited to six players), an
inter-play of slow blues, rag­
time, and fast, bouncy tunes, and
complete independence to use
solos and adlibs as the oppor­
tunities arise for such.</p>
<p>Which music is the oldest?
Dixieland by about 30 years.
Progressive jazz was introduced
bv the swing bands of the <date><sic>19305</sic></date>.
Which music is the best? Like
every other debatable question
in the world, that is strictly up
to the individual. I concede any
favoritism to the Progressives.
After all they want it the most.
I also suggest the matter be
dropped.

Editor:
Although I don’t wish to per­
petuate the dixieland vsv Pro
gressive Jazz hassle brewing on
campus I feel, as do many
others, that such infantile state­
ments as those printed in recent
issues of the DRK deserve some'
comment.</p>
<p>In the first place, it is exactly
such obnoxious remarks as those
made by pseudo-hip progres­
sivites that taint the whole
realm of Progressive jazz. Any
real jazz fan deserving of re­
cognition would never be so
dogmatic or un-enlightened as to
scorn a musical movement which
has contributed so greatly to the
development of Progressive jazz
as has Dixieland.</p>
<p>Thirdly, knowing many of the
members of the <orgName>Conover-Theimer
<sic>“Dig Rand”</sic></orgName> personally, I’m
quite sure that such representa­
tive Progressive musicians as
<persName>Jack Holiday</persName>, <persName>Charley Walp</persName>,
<persName>Mert Oliver</persName>, <persName>Marky Markowitz</persName>,
and <persName>Joe Theimer</persName> are not at all
happy about being so grossly
mis-represented by a pack of
high-schoolish zelots, such as
those letter writers of last Fri­
day’s <orgName><sic>DRK</sic></orgName> issue. In factxthose
supposedly v“cool” people would
have been exceedingly embar­
rassed by the comments I re­
received when I showed their
ridiculous letter to <persName>Marky</persName> and
some of the other musicians.
And finally, the so called
“hip” language is strictly passe
except for such ostentatious
pseudos who would like to feel
that they belong to the jazz
world. Musicians, who have
invented and used their own
specialized universal terms and
sayings for over 30 years, are
now appalled by the commer­
cialization and cliqueism which
has become an adolescent-like
fad, and they have largely
abandoned the useage of what is
rightfully their own.
See you around,
